Natural language processing (NLP) is the ability of a computer program to understand human language as it is spoken and written -- referred to as natural language. It is a component of artificial intelligence. NLP enables computers to understand natural language as humans do. Whether the language is spoken or written, natural language processing uses artificial intelligence to take real-world input, process it, and make  sense of it in a way a computer can understand. Just as humans have different sensors -- such as ears to hear and  eyes to see -- computers have programs to read and  microphones to collect audio. And just as humans have a brain to process that input, computers have a program to  process their respective inputs. At some point in processing, the input is converted to code that the computer can understand. In simple terms, NLP represents the automatic handling of natural human language like speech or text, and although the concept itself is fascinating, the real value behind  this technology comes from the use cases.Syntax and semantic analysis are  two main techniques used with natural language processing. Syntax is the arrangement of  words in a sentence to make grammatical sense. NLP uses syntax to assess meaning from a language based on  grammatical rules. Syntax techniques include:Parsing is the grammatical analysis of a sentence. This is useful for more complex downstream  processing tasks. Word segmentation is the act of taking a string of text and deriving word forms from it. Example: A person scans a handwritten document into a computer. The algorithm would be able to analyze the page and recognize that the words are 
divided by white spaces. Sentence breaking places sentence boundaries in large texts. Morphological segmentation divides words into smaller parts called morphemes
